# NSE V8 — Legacy Fundamental Cache Basis Migration (2026-10-30)

## Purpose
Safely mark old fundamental-cache rows that predate `MetricCalculationBasis` tracking.

## Behavior
- Missing/blank `MetricCalculationBasis` becomes `LEGACY_CACHE_BASIS_UNKNOWN`.
- Adds an explanatory `QuarterlyAlignmentReason` when that field is also blank.
- Preserves all existing metric values, source fields, filing metadata, and historical `MetricPeriodAlignmentStatus`.
- Does not infer quarterly or annual basis from `FinancialPeriodEnd`, publication date, or a legacy alignment flag.
- Does not convert unknown records into verified quarterly TTM records.
- New records continue to receive the basis assigned by the provider fetch logic.

## Files
- `fundamental_data_provider.py`
- `test_fundamental_data_provider.py`

## Validation performed locally
- Fundamental provider tests: 8 passed.
- Fundamental alignment/filter/fail-closed/official-filing/cache-persistence tests: 40 passed.
- Python compile check: passed.

## Important limitations
This is a local patch only; it has not been pushed to GitHub and has not been run against live NSE/Yahoo endpoints. It does not independently verify official filings or recalculate legacy financial metrics. Unknown legacy basis remains unknown until refreshed from a source that supplies a traceable calculation basis.

No changes to Master Specification, RVOL, Delivery A/B, liquidity thresholds, 30-day refresh interval, or downstream trading filters.


## Free-source fundamentals policy

- Official NSE integrated financial filings and XBRL are the primary verification source. A value is treated as officially verified only after it is reconciled with a dated filing and matching period/basis.
- Yahoo Finance accessed through `yfinance` is a secondary, no-token provider for candidate metrics and valuation snapshots. It can be delayed, incomplete, revised, or inconsistent; provider values remain unverified until the NSE filing audit confirms them.
- No paid provider token or paid data API is required by the scanner. Missing, stale, or conflicting figures remain visible as `WAIT_FOR_DATA` or a mismatch instead of being guessed or promoted.
- No shortlist threshold is weakened to compensate for missing source data. Review NSE XBRL and provider diagnostics when coverage is incomplete.
